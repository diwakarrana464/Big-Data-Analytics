This repository contains Data Analysis Example of Lab of NITT
## Problem 1 : Word Count in file
## Problem 2: A dataset is given in which record has two attributes
            Date                 Temperature 
            dd-mm-yyyy(format)   Degree Celsius
            11-11-2018             33
            29-05-2019             52

## we have to process the data and find out maximum temperature in corresponding year
## sample output
            Year                        Max Temperature
            2018                        51
            2019                        52
